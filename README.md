This project is the neighborhood-library project. There's a main menu where you can choose 1 of 3 options: 1) show available books you can check out, 2) see checked out books and return a book, and 3) to close the program.![Screenshot 2023-10-16 184948](https://github.com/OnionWithLayers/neighborhood-library/assets/146871203/c577d527-870c-4c39-9377-0e73c868618d)
